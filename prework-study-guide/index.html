        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content.</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements, which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The  meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media formats.</li>
          <li>There  are three ways to style a webpage using CSS which are inline, internal, and external.</li>
          <li>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.</li>
          <li>An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.</li>
          <li>An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.</li>
          <li>An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a style element.</li>
          <li>An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.</li>
          <li>The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.</li>
          <li>The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.</li>
          <li>The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.</li>
          <li>In CSS, the individual lines of "code," or the commands you create to style your HTML, are called rules.</li>
          <li>Each CSS rule contains two main parts, selectors and declarations. Within a declaration, there are multiple components of CSS rule syntax to understand.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds all modifications in the current working branch to the staging area</li>
          <li>git commit -m: commits the staged changes</li>
          <li>git pull origin (branch): makes sure local branch is in sync with the base branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language.</li>
          <li>It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.</li>
          <li>JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.</li>
          <li>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.</li>
          <li>JavaScript statements are made of: Values, Operators, Keywords, Expressions, and Comments.</li>
          <li>JavaScript Syntax is used to define the set of rules to construct a JavaScript program.</li>
          <li>There are two types of values defined in JavaScript Syntax:</li>
          <li>Fixed Values: These are known as the literals.</li>
          <li>Variable values: These are ccalled variables.</li>
          <li>A JavaScript variable is the simple name of the storage location where data is stored.</li>
          <li>JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to compute the value or in other words, we can perform operations on operands.</li>
          <li>Javascript Expression is the combination of values, operators, and variables. It is used to compute the values.</li>
          <li>JavaScript functions are the blocks of code used to perform some particular operations. JavaScript function is executed when something calls it.</li>
